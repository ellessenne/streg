    The `streg` function is the main function of this package, which allows fitting parametric proportional hazards survival models.
    Supported models are the exponential, the Weibull, and the Gompertz model.

- title: Predictions
  description: >
    The `predict.streg` method has been implemented to obtain predictions from a fitted `streg` model.
    Currently you can obtain the linear predictor, the hazard function, and the survival probability.
    Out of sample predictions and prediction standard errors are supported out-of-the-box.
